Cryptography Project
We designed a Java program to convert each block of cipher text into plaintext. The program uses many functions to complete this task and it also uses a scanner so that the user can input each block of cipher text to be decrypted. A list of functions in the program are as follows: 
  •	factorP which is a function that factors n and finds p. The parameters that are passed are int n and then the function returns the correct p value. 
  •	factorQ which is a function that factors n and finds q. The parameters that are passed are int p and int n and then the function returns the correct q value. 
  •	multiplicativeInverse which is a function that computes the multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. The parameters that are passed are int e, int p, and int q and then the function returns the correct d value.
  •	modExponentation which is a function that computes the cipher text using the repeated squaring method. The parameters that are passed are int c, int d, and int n and then the function returns the correct ct value. 
  •	firstLetter which is a function that finds the first letter in the cipher text. The parameters that are passed are int ct and then the function returns the correct fL character.   
  •	secondLetter which is a function that finds the second letter in the cipher text. The parameters that are passed are int ct and then the function returns the correct sL character.   
  •	thirdLetter which is a function that finds the third letter in the cipher text. The parameters that are passed are int ct and then the function returns the correct tL character.
